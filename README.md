BPX is a new generation Ethereum-compatible blockchain based upon an innovative consensus algorithm, Proof of Space and Time known from the Chia Network. Proof of Space is a cryptographic technique where farmers prove that they allocate unused hard disk space to the network. Proof of Time increases the overall security of the blockchain.
